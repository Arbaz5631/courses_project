            <h1 class="display-4">Java Programming</h1>
            <p class="lead">Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and
                designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
                developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
                that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to
                bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
                architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than
                either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
                GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

            <hr class="my-4">
            <p> Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by
                Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and
                reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released
                by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java
                Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public
                License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as
                the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web
                (browser plugin for applets).</p>
